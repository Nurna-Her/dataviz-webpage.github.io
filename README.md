## My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for a static website hosted with **GitHub Pages**.

On my page, you can learn a bit about me and my work, and also check what I'm currently working on.

The site is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any external frameworks, and was originally built using a publicly available template. It is intended to be kept simple, as I am planning on revamping it in the near future.

If you would like to use this page as a template for your portfolio, feel completely free to do so!
